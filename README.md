# CLI ripper for AAX (Audible) files.


## Description
```
Creates a properly tagged .M4B / 
MP4, with (optional) a copy of the JGP cover, an NFO and a CUE file.
Created with the purpose of being a "one-click" ripper.

## Usage
Should be set as an environment variable for ease of use.

```bash
iAmDeaf <full_path_to_aax>
```
Otherwise can be set as the default program to handle .aax files.
It can then be started by simply double clicking the file, or just entering the path to the encrypted book without the "iAmDeaf" prefix.
